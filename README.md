# FdF

This project is about creating a simplified graphic “wireframe” representation of a relief landscape
linking various points (x, y, z) via segments. The coordinates of this landscape are stored in a file
passed as a parameter to the program.
Project uses graphic library - **miniLibX**, that was developed
by french School 42 (École 42) and includes the minimum necessary to open a window, light a pixel and deal
with events linked to this window: keyboard and mouse.<br/>
